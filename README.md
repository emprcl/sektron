# Sektron

Sektron is a midi step sequencer, made with live performance in mind, that runs in the terminal (TUI).
Its main purpose is to mimic the fun and immediacity of hardware sequencers by being entirely controllable via keyboard.

It's heavily inspired by [elektron devices](https://www.elektron.se).

**_Sektron is still under heavy development. Features are missing and it's probably unstable._**

## Installation



### Build it yourself

You'll need [go 1.18](https://go.dev/dl/) minimum.
Although you should be able to build it for either **linux**, **macOS** or **Windows**, it has only been tested on **linux**.

```sh
# Linux
make GOLANG_OS=linux build

# macOS
make GOLANG_OS=darwin build

# Windows
make GOLANG_OS=windows build
```

Then:
```sh
./bin/sektron
```


## Usage

```sh
./bin/sektron
```

Hit `?` to see all keybindings. `esc` to quit.

[Qsynth](https://qsynth.sourceforge.io/) is a nice companion app for testing Sektron.

### Keyboard mapping

Keys mapping is fully customizable. After running Sektron for the first time, a `config.json` is created.
You can edit all the keys inside it.

The default key mapping looks like this:

![keyboard layout](/docs/keyboard-layout.png)

You can select one of the fex default keyboard layouts are available:
```sh
# QWERTY
./bin/sektron --keyboard qwerty

# AZERTY
./bin/sektron --keyboard azerty

# QWERTY MAC
./bin/sektron --keyboard qwerty-mac

# AZERTY MAC
./bin/sektron --keyboard azerty-mac
```

### Patterns management

Each time you start Sektron, a json file (default: `patterns.json`) containing 128 pattern slots is loaded.
For selecting a different file, use the `--patterns` flag:
```sh
./bin/sektron --patterns my-patterns.json
```

## Acknowledgments

Sektron uses a few awesome packages:
 - [gomidi/midi](https://gitlab.com/gomidi/midi) for all midi communication
 - [charmbracelet/bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) as the main TUI framework
 - [charmbracelet/lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) for making things beautiful

## Roadmap for 0.1

 - [x] Exhaustive midi messages type (CC etc...)
 - [x] Basic pattern management (and chaining)
 - [x] Key mapping management and configuration
 - [ ] Improve controls UX
 - [ ] Write documentation

## Roadmap for later

 - Step polyphony
 - Keyboard mode
 - Live record
 - More random/generative features
 - Retrigs
 - LFOs
